# 1440pAutoSaddle
A simple python automation script to perform a repetitive task in a video game (Ark Survival Ascended)
-For a more exact description the script prompts the user for the name of the specific saddle they are wanting to auto-equip, then when they go to open the inventory to put on the saddle, the script performs all of the repetitive actions for the user much quicker than a human ever could
